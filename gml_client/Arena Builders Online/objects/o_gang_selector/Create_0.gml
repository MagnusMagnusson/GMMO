	"A guild of craftsmen and artisans, The Crimson Guild is composed of those that find beauty in crafting endlessly complicated systems, of discussing shared plans of grandeur, and sharing in their expertise. Not always with good sense of what is and isn't reasonable with the resources granted,  the guild often takes on tasks requiring all their shared skills and teamwork to adequately pull off. However, somehow they always seem to get across the finish line with a little help from a fellow craftsman",
	"A band of merchants, the Blu Cru travels the land to show off their wares and keep a finger on the politics of the land. Utilizing blueberries as currency the Cru constantly keeps in touch with a fellow adventurer, trading goods and stories and experience. The Blu Cru collects not only treasure, but intrigue and influence, for there is little that gets past an organized band of merchants who interact with all classes of society in search of the best deal",
	"A sacred order of monks, Yellowship is a small but ancient faction. Living in relative isolation around the peaks and valleys of mountains and highlands, the Yellowship follow the grand guidance of their yellow king, and the vigilant eye of the sun that grants life to the land. One should never underestimate a member of the Yellowship, and one who gets on their good side could learn much from their council as you walk beneath the lemon trees, who during the harvest grow so thick and fruitful that the soil smells of citrus and the rivers run sour of lemonade.",
	"A merry band of entertainers, the Emerald Enclave are a joyful bunch as they gather in the groves of the forest. Playing instruments, telling jokes, and sharing in harmonious banter, the Enclave know how to throw a party. While some of their ways may appear strange – conversing with racoons, drinking ale with aliens, and playing homage to the aesthetics of long forgotten times – one cannot deny that very few factions are as good company as the Enclave",
	"The mysterious Cult of Purple confounds and confuses even the most clever man as they gather in the night, growling to instruments made of heavy metals, the violet fog creeps across the sky and engulfs the land. Despite their occult ways, many can’t help but to be drawn to a cult meeting, for it is undeniable that there is something intoxicating about that aesthetic. One should not underestimate the cult, for while little is known of their rituals, it is hard to doubt that they don’t have a trick or two up their sleeves at all times"
